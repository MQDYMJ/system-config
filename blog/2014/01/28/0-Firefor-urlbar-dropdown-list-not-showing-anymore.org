#+title: Firefor urlbar dropdown list not showing anymore
# bhj-tags: Bug
On my Linux machine, after using firefox for a while, I often suddenly
notice that the urlbar dropdown list in not showing anymore when I
type in it. No auto completion, no dropdown list, no anything.

I used to restart the firefox and it got fixed. But this is very
annoying.

Now I found it might be because of the ibus input method. After I
switch on and off the Chinese input method, the urlbar dropdown list
and auto completion is back.
