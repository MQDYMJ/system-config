#+title: beagrep is made even faster
# bhj-tags: beagrep

~beagrep -e readlink~ in my android source tree now takes only 0.230
second on Dell Optiplex 960 (cache hot).

The trick I used is to simply enable Mono's AOT option (see git log).

But sadly, I can't improve it on my macbookair with debian
installation to the same speed as on my Optiplex 960. This is very
strange since the macbookair is a more powerful machine with better
CPU and SSD (which does not matter when cache is hot though).

The time on macbookair is consistently ~0.8 second slower than
Optiplex 960, AOT or not AOT.
