#+title: beagrep performance tuning on MacbookAir+Linux

[[../../../2011/12/23/beagrep.org][beagrep]] has been slow on my MacbookAir with Linux installation. Where
it takes 0.23 second to =beagrep -e readlink= on my Optiplex 960, it
took about 1 second on my MBA.

Finally it turns out to be the cpu clock is locked at 800MHz on
MBA. See [[https://zignar.net/2012/12/20/linux-on-a-macbook-air/][Linux on a MacBook Air 2012]] for how to fix this.

With this change, bare grep is still not as fast as it is on Optiplex
960: where Optiplex 960 takes only 3.5s, MacbookAir is taking 40
seconds. And same with beagrep: where Optiplex 960 takes 0.23s to
beagrep Android, MacbookAir is taking 0.38s.
