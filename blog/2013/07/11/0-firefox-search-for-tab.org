#+title: Bash/sawfish scripts to force firefox open in a certain tab
# bhj-tags: system-config

In [[../05/0-firefox-smart-new-tab.org][Firefox: -new-tab or no -new-tab]] I put forward a method to make
firefox try very hard to open a utility webpage in a new tab /only/ if
the *current tab* is not visiting the same utility.

Now I took one step forward (after practicing more with the idea in
[[../09/0-sawfish-keyboard-macro.org][Simple scripts to record/play keyboard macro (sawfish)]]), if *any tab*
is visiting the same utility (with a regexp matching), firefox will
try to open the url in that tab.

The idea is very simple, just switch all the tabs around with C-f (I'm
using Firemacs and this key is defined to be NextTab), then check the
url it's visiting, if it matches the utility's url pattern, then we
use that tab. Only if we can't find such a tab do we use a new one.

The scripts are located at [[https://github.com/baohaojun/system-config/raw/master/bin/my-dict][my-dict]] (the utility),
[[https://github.com/baohaojun/system-config/raw/master/bin/firefox-search-for-tab][firefox-search-for-tab]] and [[https://github.com/baohaojun/system-config/raw/master/bin/get-firefox-tab-url][get-firefox-tab-url]]. Oh, and another script
is [[https://github.com/baohaojun/system-config/raw/master/bin/sawfish-send-window-event][sawfish-send-window-event]].
