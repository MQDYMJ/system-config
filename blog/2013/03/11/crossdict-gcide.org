#+title: How to extract GCIDE dictionary data for CrossDict
# bhj-tags: dict

The dictionary data that comes with CrossDict is extracted from [[ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcide/][GCIDE]],
which is a GNU project and therefor also free. I have fixed some bugs
in the [[http://puszcza.gnu.org.ua/software/dico/][dico]] project and used it to extract the dictionary data, and
[[https://github.com/baohaojun/dico][here]] it is my changes.
