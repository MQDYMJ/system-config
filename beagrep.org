#+title: beagrep, grep 2G source code in 2 seconds

* Introduction

I still remember when I read the ``Linux Device Drivers'', 1st Edition, in the preface, the author says:

#+begin_quote
... The text you are approaching is the result of hours of patient grepping ...
#+end_quote

I have been using grep to read source code ever since. It's been
adequate for a long time, until I started reading Android source code
with it. I remember vividly how it took me 30 minutes to ~grep
readlink~ in Android source code (with VCS directory and binary files
excluded).

Then I learned about the beagle software, and it occured to me, what
if I use beagle and grep together? I mean, to use beagle first to
decide the (relatively a lot smaller) set of possible matching files
(i.e., files that contained the word ~readlink~, taking the previous
example), then invoke grep on this set only. Usually the job can be
done in a couple of seconds.

Beagrep supports both Linux and Windows (requires CYGWIN).

* Install
** Linux Install

*** Dependencies

Take debian as example, you may need to install the following packages (TODO: make a .deb for it):
#+begin_example
dpkg-query

libc6-dev
libglib2.0-0
libglib2.0-cil
libglib2.0-dev
libgmime2.4-cil

#+end_example

*** Download Code
#+begin_example
git clone git://github.com/baohaojun/beagrep.git -b Linux
#+end_example

*** Compile and Install
In the beagrep directory you just git cloned:

#+begin_example
cd beagrep
autoreconf -i
make
sudo make install
#+end_example

** Windows Install

*** Dependencies

- Install cygwin.

- Install mono.

*** Download Code
#+begin_example
git clone git://github.com/baohaojun/beagrep.git -b Windows
#+end_example

*** Compile and Instal

#+begin_example
cd beagrep
bash build-win.sh
#+end_example

* Usage

** Create Index

In the source code directory you want to ``beagrep'', for e.g. android, 

#+begin_example
cd ~/src/android
mkbeagrepidx
#+end_example

This will take quite some time (about the same amount of time you take
to run ~grep~ directly in the source code directory, i.e., ~0.5 hour).

** run beagrep

In the source code directory (or any subdirs under it)
#+begin_example
cd ~/src/android
beagrep -e "readlink"
#+end_example
