<p>Gimme a skeleton, and I'll complete you, man!
</p>
<p>
<code>Skeleton-complete</code> is my effort to push <code>hippie-expand</code> to
extremes. With it you can save a lot of typing even more than
hippie-expand. To be more specific, it is hippie-expand's
<code>try-expand-dabbrev</code> and <code>try-expand-line</code> functions that I want to do
better with skeleton-complete.

<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> What's not good enough with hippie-expand</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
Emacs completion (aka expand) is great, the hippie-expand is mostly
useful.
</p>
<p>
But I have found it insufficient, for the following reasons.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Hippie-expand requires you to start matching at the beginning.

<p>
   But not all interesting (and thus easy to remember and easy to
   type) components are at the beginning. A lot of software including
   Emacs itself have started to allow user type a component from
   anywhere in the final string and match it just fine. For e.g., the
   anything.el (now renamed helm); Firefox's URL type and match; and
   Emacs's built in <code>C-h f</code> (where you can type <code>-hello</code> and <code>Tab</code>,
   and Emacs will expand it to <code>view-hello-file</code>: you do not need
   start with <code>view</code>. Not so with hippie-expand).
</p>
</li>
<li>Selecting from multiple matches is not instinctive.

<p>
   Given the file below as an example, say the point is at where <code>**</code>
   is located, when you type <code>M-/</code> repeatedly, you will get hello3, 2,
   1, and then hello4, 5, 6, in that order (what will you get after
   hello6 is dependent on what is contained in other buffers of your
   current Emacs session, what modules you have loaded and symbols you
   can access, etc. See <code>hippie-expand-try-functions-list</code>. This is
   NICE and inspiring!).
</p>



<pre class="example">hello1
hello2
hello3
he**
hello4
hello5
hello6
</pre>


<p>
   Now, the order is not satisfactory to me, I'd like 3, 4, 2, 5, 1, 6
   better according roughly to the distance they are to the <i>point</i>.
</p>
<p>
   And like anything.el, I'd like to see all the matching entries at
   once, probably over multiple pages, but I can scroll up and down to
   choose, instead of typing <code>M-/</code> repeatedly and blindly, not knowing
   what the next entry will be, or how many times I need to press <code>M-/</code>.
</p>
<p>
   Last but not least, as has been stated in 1), I need start with
   <code>he**</code>, and if what I wanted is <code>hello6</code>, then 6 times I must press
   along <code>M-/</code>.
</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> How does skeleton-complete fix it</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
Taking the above example, if you wanted to get <code>hello6</code>, you need only
type the skeleton, the “interesting” bones that we want to flesh
out: the <code>h</code> and <code>6</code> is enough in this example, see below (only <code>he</code>
is changed to <code>h6</code> compared to above example):
</p>



<pre class="example">hello1
hello2
hello3
h6**
hello4
hello5
hello6
</pre>


<p>
If you type <code>M-g &lt;return&gt;</code> at the point, you will get <code>hello6</code>
instantly.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Regexp rewrite</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">


<p>
Here's how it works. <code>Skeleton-complete</code> will take the
<code>(current-word)</code>, here <code>h6</code>, and break this “skeleton” down into
bare pieces of bones, <code>h</code> and <code>6</code>. Then it strings these bones
together, and we get <code>h.*6</code>, and behold, this is a regexp! What use do
we have regexps? Right, searching. We can search and find 2 matches
for <code>h.*6</code>: <code>h6</code> and <code>hello6</code>. Now the first one does not make much
sense as it is the same as the skeleton we started with; so we can
happily complete with <code>hello6</code>, and the user is not bothered to select
from multiple matches at all!
</p>
<p>
(In Emacs version 24.3, you will notice in <code>isearch-forward</code>, typing
many white spaces has the same effect as one, and it will match any
number of contiguous white spaces (except the newline). Déjà vu?)
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Choosing from multiple matches</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">


<p>
But of course, often the user still need to choose from multiple
matches. <code>Skeleton-complete</code> uses <code>ecomplete.el</code> for presenting the
user the matches he/she can choose from:
</p>
<p>
<img src="skeleton-id.png"  alt="../../../../skeleton-id.png" />
</p>
<p>
From the screenshot, you can see that the matches are presented in a
order according to their distance to the point. According to principle
of locality, the closer the match to the point, the earlier it should
appear in the list of choices. In the figure above, displayed first is
<code>hyhyhy1</code> which comes immediately above the point, then the <code>h1</code>
itself should have come, which is below or on the same line as the
point, but it has been deleted as it makes no sense as a completion
for itself. So next comes <code>hahaha1</code> which is the next above the point,
followed by <code>hihihi1</code> which is the next below, and so on.
</p>
<p>
You can use <code>C-n</code> and <code>C-p</code> to scroll up and down the list, or off the
ends to the next and previous pages of matches.

<div id="outline-container-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> The second flavor of skeleton-complete</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">


<p>
The first flavor discussed above is for completing <b>identifiers</b>
only. Say I have a long expression, and I will complete the whole
expression, once again you type an “interesting” skeleton, and type
<code>M-s &lt;return&gt;</code>, it will get fleshed out:
</p>
<p>
<img src="skeleton-exp.png"  alt="../../../../skeleton-exp.png" />
</p>
<p>
Here's how it works. First the skeleton is broken down to bare bones,
<code>$</code>, <code>h</code>, <code>1</code> and <code>}</code>. Then they are stringed to become
<code>\\$.*?h.*?1.*?}</code> (note how the <code>$</code> is quoted because besides being a
bone, it's also a “meta”bone; also note the usage of the non-greedy
<code>.*?</code>, it is dark magic already, do not make it worse by being
greedy<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.1" href="#fn-.1">1</a></sup>!).
</p>
<p>
Then all the expressions in the current buffer are matched, and they
are listed in the same way as the first flavor (Thus the user should
say, “oh, I have seen this before.” and feel easy. Déjà vu<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.2" href="#fn-.2">2</a></sup>?).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Usage notes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
There are several tried and proved enhancements in
skeleton-complete that you might want to know.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Besides the current buffer, all <b>visible</b> buffers are searched for matches.

<p>
   Edit: think <code>try-expand-dabbrev-visible</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>If no matches are found in all the visible buffers, the buried
   buffers are dug up for skeleton bones (but don't sweat, it will
   stop as soon as the first dark buffer is finished where any match
   is found).

<p>
   Edit: think <code>try-expand-dabbrev-all-buffers</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>Because of 1) and the fact that <code>ecomplete.el</code> is used, you can use
   skeleton-complete in the minibuffer. I only made key binding for
   the second flavor, <code>M-g x</code>, you probably need use it too, because
   <code>M-s &lt;return&gt;</code> is often not usable in the minibuffer.

<p>
   I mean, you won't get punished with <code>Command attempted to use    minibuffer while in minibuffer</code> for digging skeletons in the lowest
   place of all, the minibuffer.
</p>
<p>
   Edit: This is also the reason why I have not yet replaced
   ecomplete.el with anything.el to choose from multiple matches: the
   latter can't be used in the minibuffer without the error above.
</p>
</li>
<li>If the first character of a 2nd flavor skeleton is a word
   constituent character, it must match at beginning of a word.

<p>
   For e.g., <code>lr</code> will not match <code>hello world</code>, you must change the
   skeleton to <code>hr</code> (the last character of the skeleton is not
   constrained).
</p>
<p>
   A skeleton without a right skull is very difficult to complete!<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.3" href="#fn-.3">3</a></sup>
</p>
</li>
<li>Arbitrary single line string can be completed with the 2nd
   flavor. Not necessarily only expressions!

</li>
<li>By default, the 2nd flavor will find its skeleton by searching
   backward for the first non-blank character. You can override this by
   activating the region over your desired skeleton and include white
   spaces into it.

</li>
<li>Use interesting bones as much as possible.

<p>
   In the above example, the <code>h</code> in <code>h6</code> is not interesting, because
   everybody has this bone. You can discard it and use <code>6</code> alone,
   because only <code>hello6</code> has this interesting bone in it, and it is
   exactly what you wanted.
</p>
</li>
<li>You can use complete and modify if you need input a similar but not
   exactly same string to an existing one.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Bugs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
Because the rewrote regexp can be complex, sometimes (but very
rarely!) it may seem hung for the 2nd flavor. You can type <code>C-g</code> to
quit searching for matches, and examine what is wrong with your
skeleton.
</p>
<p>
Beware of buffers with extremely long lines in it! Those are monsters,
don't try to use 2nd flavor skeleton-complete with them, run away!

<div id="footnotes">
<h2 class="footnotes">Footnotes: </h2>
<div id="text-footnotes">
<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn-.1" href="#fnr-.1">1</a></sup> In the first flavor, either greedy or non-greedy
will do. But in the 2nd flaver, I must use non-greedy to give user
more control: given <code>$double_hash{$ref1}{$ref2}</code>, greedy <code>${}</code> and
<code>${}}</code> will both match the whole thing, but the non-greedy version
will empower user to choose <code>$double_hash{$ref1}</code> and
<code>$double_hash{$ref1}{$ref2}</code> respectively.
</p>


<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn-.2" href="#fnr-.2">2</a></sup> I typed the 2nd and this <code>Déjà vu</code> with <code>dvu</code> and <code>M-s &lt;return&gt;</code>. And the 1st is typed as <code>D\'ej\`a vu</code> and <code>M-x iso-tex2iso</code>, if you don't know already:-)
</p>


<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn-.3" href="#fnr-.3">3</a></sup> The real reason is, without this constraint, <code>hello world</code> will generate 2 meaningless matches for the skeleton <code>lr</code> and
user is likely to get disappointed: <code>llo wor</code> and <code>lo wor</code>. As for the
tail, we can easily extend it to the word boundary: <code>llo world</code> and
<code>lo world</code>, but for the missing head, let's simply forbid it, because
it's also a performance hit by causing these unwanted matches.
