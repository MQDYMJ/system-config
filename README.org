Org-Kungfu is for using org-mode with Confluence.

Here's how does it work, it's very simple:

#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file images/org-kungfu.png :exports results :cmdline -Kdot -Tpng
  digraph {
          OrgMode -> HTML [ label = " export  " ]
          HTML -> Confluence [ label = " REST API  " ]
          Confluence -> HTML [ label = " REST API  " ]
          HTML -> OrgMode [ label = " pandoc  " ]
  }
#+END_SRC

I started out attempting to write this tool in pure Emacs Lisp, but I have failed. As the original author of [[https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira][Org-Jira]], I thought this should be easy, since both Jira and Confluence are from the same company, but it turns out I was wrong.

In the end, I wrote it in Perl, Org-mode (for Literate Programming), and a little bit Emacs Lisp.

* Usage

Here's how to use it (see the Usage section in org-kongfu.org):

=./org-kungfu -w WIKIURL -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD e -p PAGE_ID=

** Required Software and Version

*** Pandoc

Pandoc 2.7 is highly recommended. Pandoc 1.17.2 on Debian Stable can't output as neat org-mode text when converting html to org-mode.

*** Perl

Perl version v5.28 is recommended (at least v5.24 won't work, as I recently found out on Debian Stable: it does not support this operator syntax: =<<~=).

Before you can use this script, you need make sure you have the following Perl packages installed:

- Config::Simple
- HTTP::Request::Common
- LWP::UserAgent
- JSON
- Mojo::DOM

* Known Bugs

This tool is part of my [[https://github.com/baohaojun/system-config][system-config]] project, it's not stand alone, some features may require the system-config scripts installed.

And, I have not tested it out of system-configðŸ˜….

It's also still work in progress, some desired features have not been worked out yet, for e.g., automatically uploading images in Org-mode to Confluence.

Your help is welcome!
